## General
BingoCpp is part of the open source package Bingo for performing symbolic 
regression.  BingoCpp contains the c++ implementation of a portion of the code 
within bingo. 

## Getting Started

### Cloning
BingoCpp has 3 submodules: eigen, google test, and pybind.  To clone this 
repository and include the submodules, run the following command:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules
```

### Installation
Installing from source requires git and a recent version of 
[cmake](https://cmake.org/).

Installation can be performed using the typical out-of-source build flow:
```
mkdir <path_to_source_dir>/build
cd <path_to_source_dir>/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

### Python Bindings
The python bindings that are needed for integration with bingo can be made by 
running the following commend from the build directory:
```
make bingocpp
```

A common error in the build of the python bindings is that the build must be 
use the same version of python that will run your bingo scripts.  Pybind 
usually finds the default python on your machine during build, so the easiest 
way to ensure consistent python versioning is to build bingocpp in a Python 3 
virtual environment.

### Documentation
Sphynx is used for automatically generating API documentation for bingo. The 
most recent build of the documentation can be found in the repository at: 
doc/_build/html/index.html 

## Running Tests
Several unit and integration tests can be performed upon building, to ensure a 
proper install.  The test suite can be started by running the following command
from the build directory:
```
make gtest
```
